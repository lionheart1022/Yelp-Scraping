He is an amazing doctor who genuinely cares about his patients and their care. \u00a0After moving back to Orlando, I am so happy to see he is practicing again and his office is near my new home. . He is the primary doctor for my entire family. He offers solutions that are beyond medicinal and also offers holistic approaches for those who are interested in that path. He sits with you as long as he needs to in the room and listens to all of your concerns. He cares for your well-being and orders really detailed check-ups to truly see your condition and explore the core root of your problems instead of just masking them with medication. I am so happy to have landed again in this office and I am so happy he is our family doctor again. . The only downside to his office are the wait times but I must say its worth it. It may get frustrating waiting beyond your appointment time but when you are inside and he is giving you that individual attention you are so thankful you waited. \u00a0I always leave satisfied. Very happy with Dr. Alatriste and I highly recommend him!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jLNYaW1eZvXOTKe6be0p2Q/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Stefany M."}, {"timestamp": 1375131600, "content": "Dr. Anthony Alatriste is not only the most compassionate doctor I have ever had the pleasure to be a patient of but he is also one of the most compassionate human beings I have ever come across in my 27 years of life.. This is by no means an exaggeration as I have witnessed him not only care for myself but my entire family for years. He even made multiple house visits during the unfortunate time when my mother was fighting lung cancer and was too ill to travel, refusing to charge for them as well.. The downside is that as of my writing this he is only in his office on Wednesdays as he still is a practicing ER doctor as well. He also tends to run behind on office days due to the limited appointments available as well as the fact that he spends a lot of time with each patient. \u00a0It is my opinion that the level of care far outweighs any of the cons in working with him.. Some people are just born to be and do certain things, \"Dr. A\" \u00a0has found his true calling as a doctor..
