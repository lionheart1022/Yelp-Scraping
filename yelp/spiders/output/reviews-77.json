{"external_system_unique_id": 77, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1504213200, "content": "I've lived in Florida for 20 years and I can honestly say Dr. Steed is one of my favorite doctors. He listens, he cares, and he's thorough. I went from being strong, active, and healthy in August 2015, to feeling 20 years older and in constant pain a month later. I honestly believe if I had been to see Dr Steed in 2015, instead of the other doctors I went to, I would still be strong, healthy, and pain-free today. Instead, I came to him just this year, with numerous health issues, and he has been working to address every single one of them. If you want a doctor who truly cares, really listens, and wants to help, Dr. Steed is the one to go to. Unfortunately he is going to be leaving Family Doctors of Belleview in November, leaving my daughter and I to try to find another doctor that we can trust and feel comfortable with. I think his PA, Jamie, will be staying. She is also is very kind and helpful. The office staff is wonderful too. If Dr. Steed moves his practice to an area you are able to go to, I highly recommend him. We are going to really miss having him as our primary doctor.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/eQtLFshJ-38774PiuV24gA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Angela 'Angie' D."}]}
