She was convinced I had a very serious illness which I did not, but I was very scared for a few days. She sent me to a hospital without writing anything down, despite me asking for something in writing. The hospital sent me back. I waited another 2 hours. The waiting room is gross. The front desk was very rude... I never got the information I needed from this office. I ended up going to Northwestern Medicine instead and have never looked back!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Angela P."}, {"timestamp": 1398114000, "content": "seems to know her stuff but it was a 2-hour wait to see her (with an appointment).. the front desk staff doesn't seem to know very much.. the office itself is kind of beat up and crowded.. they also don't take credit cards for co-pays, which is a hassle.. you can do better.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 2, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Chris D."}]}
