It's not fun to be sick and bloated and sore and in pain and not know why. \u00a0I had been searching for an answer for a couple years and finally, with Dr. Hunt's expertise, found out what was wrong.. He is gracious, kind, patient, loving and God fearing. \u00a0He is an expert in his field and I am so blessed to have him in my corner. \u00a0My cancer was rare and aggressive and scared the hell out of me, but Dr. Hunt walked me through all the choices and decisions that I had to face and gave me nothing but honest and bold answers to all my questions. \u00a0His staff is caring and sweet. \u00a0They always were supportive and generous with their time, never making me feel I was a pain in the butt.. I cannot recommend him, or his staff, \u00a0highly enough. \u00a0Dr. Hunt will always be a very special person in my life.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ROSgsukIBhahgGgRY5u8zg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Kimmy S."}]}
