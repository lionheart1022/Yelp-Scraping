Very new clean office, professional staff and great drs. After a very short wait in the waiting room went through my vitals and minutes later seen by the Dr. Tabrez Noorani. He was Professional and accurately diagnosed me after listening to a list of ailments.

And then after waiting for an hour I was ushered out of the door and I felt none of my questions were answered just kind of confused and frustrated at this point. The staff was nice but disconnected.

I wouldn't expect an office make me wait 2 days for an appointment like this office did. . This is the 3rd time this has happened, and I wait on average 2 hours to see a doctor (or PA) so I know others get worked in on emergency basis so... I switched doctors with this last episode.. After the doctor herself agreed that the 2 day wait was acceptable. . I'm a nurse, and that was not acceptable to me.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ANP9BxwS-t3CF4UVCu9EEQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Roxanne P."}]}
