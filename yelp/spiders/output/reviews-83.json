Once I got to the back though, they were efficient and had me in and out of there in no time. There was no ridiculous wait in between seeing nurses, the doctor, the respiratory specialist, and the x ray guy. Everything went smoothly and they made sure I had every and all prescriptions I needed. I give them 2 thumbs up! Especially being some one new who just relocated here.

I was shivering and pain in my scrotum(UTI). Headache and Nausea. They gave me antibiotics and something for the nausea. They released and I went home. I woke up at 3 am in severe pain. I waited till morning and called the hospital. I spoke to one of the charge nurses. She told me the nurses have nothing to do with the money and transferred me to financial services. I spoke to Rita told me to come in if I was sick. My goal was to have the night doctor admit me. . She told me that florida Hospital was a faith based organization. And that they would help.. I did not want to incur all the expense for tests they did last night. \u00a0So I drug myself to the hospital. I met with Rita in financial services. She now tells me that there was nothing she could do, and that she was calling the charge nurse. She told me to sit and a waited. I'm so sick. But it doesn't seem like they care. Don't know what's gonna happen I've been waiting 30 minutes.. There is no happy ending. I was admitted to the hospital after a 2 hour wait. Bottom line they still charged me for a second visit.

The first time I was taken to the ER here, I had an OK experience. \u00a0I was taken in by ambulance, so I was seen immediately. \u00a0The doctor and nurses were nice. \u00a0The tech who did my CT was nice. \u00a0. That first experience left me to believe this was an Ok hospital to come to. WRONG.. My second trip was also by ambulance. \u00a0It was pouring rain, it was February, and it was cold. \u00a0I was in an excruciating amount of pain. \u00a0When I got to the ER, they didn't take me in through the ambulance entrance, no no, they wheeled me in right through the main lobby where everyone was staring. \u00a0The a/c of the hospital hit my wet, already cold body and sent me shivering immediately. \u00a0Someone came out with paperwork asking me questions in front of everyone. \u00a0The pain was horrible and I was begging for towels and blankets. \u00a0They weren't too concerned with that... they just wanted me to answer personal questions out loud in front of the entire waiting room. \u00a0NO! \u00a0I refused, they took me back. \u00a0I lay there for a good 20 minutes in agony before a nurse finally came with towels to dry me off and blankets to help warm me. \u00a0She was also rude and nasty.. Onto the doctor. \u00a0He was worse than the nurse. \u00a0He was one of those doctors with the god-complex. \u00a0He was nothing but curt and condescending. \u00a0After running tests, he decided I needed to be admitted. \u00a0Ummm.... \u00a0no thanks! \u00a0I won't go into details with the condition I had going on, but suffice to say the pain meds they eventually gave me kicked in, so I signed one of those papers saying I was leaving against medical advice. \u00a0My husband promptly put me in the car and drove me up to Jacksonville to my usual hospital where I could be admitted. \u00a0Yes, I had to go through the whole ER thing again, but it was a much more pleasant experience. . A month or so later when I was all well and feeling better, I had my husband take me back to this hospital so I could complain to an administrator in person. \u00a0When I got there, they sent me first to the records department so they could print out my records. \u00a0They said I would need them to talk with the administrator about everything that occurred during that horrible visit. . They printed my records for me and said I wouldn't be charged since I was having them printed for the administrator. \u00a0A few weeks later, I got a bill in the mail for $40 something dollars for that printed paperwork. \u00a0WTF?!?! \u00a0. I did speak with the administrator about my grievances and she was perfectly nice and listened to every word I said. \u00a0She promised the issues would be addressed. \u00a0Then I get the darn bill in the mail for that printed paperwork. \u00a0it took me months to finally get them to take that off my account. \u00a0In the meantime, they even turned me over to collections for it. \u00a0It was quite the headache!.
