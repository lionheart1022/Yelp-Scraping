The office is clean,a d the staff is nice, and I did not feel rushed. He was glad to go over all my concerns with me. I took off a star because they can be a little disorganized (saying they will call in a prescription by 5pm, and not doing it till the next morning) and hard to get a hold of some one in the office because they use an outside answering service to screen their calls. When the prescriptions are done on time though, its very convenient because they do it via email so it goes straight to the pharmacy of you choosing. No little pieces of paper to worry about losing.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/66oEUoQrdVUJn9ulZ1pnlA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 4, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Molly B."}, {"timestamp": 1399928400, "content": "The doctor is very personally nice however the front office was very rude to me. The doctor was performing a stress test and had to end it abruptly, no reason was given to me. Instead of rescheduling, I was charged for the process, which is not fair. On another occasion, I was given a blood test, I was not told to fast; I had a large breakfast that morning, thus I showed a high blood sugar level, high cholesterol etc! \u00a0 Thus I went to a new doctor to take the blood test etc. she is great and I am very happy that I changed doctors to Dr. Shah, On cross creek blvd. Again dr. Lebowitz is a nice man, but not the doctor for me.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lTqFWeM7ShLS8y2tARolaQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Joseph A."}]}
