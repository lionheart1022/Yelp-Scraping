To catch you up: \u00a0I left work at 8:50 for my 9:00 am appointment and waited until 9:50 to be seen by my doctor then traveled another 10 minutes back to work: \u00a0I was gone over an hour, which I considered my lunch break. \u00a0I've stayed so long because of the onsite labs, MRI, ultrasounds etc. but to see my actual doctor - I've had enough.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/75Qy9SESEOg2_3BcIph09g/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Mary P."}, {"timestamp": 1488319200, "content": "I have been going here for a long time, like 10 years, and I don't see any reason to ever look for another doctor office.
