I have colon cancer and my surgeon recommended that i get a prescription for home care through my primary care provider which happens to be VMC. (i went to VMC a few days before my 8/13 surgery for anti-nausea medicine and informed them of my upcoming cancer surgery.). even though i am laid up they would not provide a prescription for home care without going to see them again. i requested a call-back directly from the PA, Laura Ems, and she did not call back. on top of that i am disabled and cannot walk.

When I first tried to make an appointment fir my kids I was told I had to go online and pre register and then someone would call me back. I did that and waited two weeks with no call back. Finally I called and made an appointment myself, which was difficult as well because no one answers the phone. . Once our appointment day finally came we got there on time and were told very rudely that we were supposed to be there 30 minutes early to fill out more paperwork. No one told me that prior to the appointment. . We got into see the doctor who was very kind and had a great bedside manner with the kids. He did forget to order one blood test for my daughter that we talked about which is not great because getting a kid to get their blood drawn is not fun so now we have to do it again. But other than that we really liked him.. We got the blood work done and it has been 3 weeks and no one from the office has called me. Finally I called the lab and got the results myself. They were completed the day after they were drawn. Turns out my son has severe iron deficient anemia (I had a friend who is a doctor look at his results when I saw several red flags) and yet no one has called me about it. My doctor friend said he's nearing blood transfusion levels and he's surprised he's walking around because he must be exhausted. But still no one will call me back. No one answers the phone, they never return messages. I have to drive over there to talk to someone.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Niki M."}, {"timestamp": 1515016800, "content": "This medical center has got to be one of the worse medical centers I've been too! For starters no one answers the phone for anything! You have to leave a message for ANY question you have because the phone just rings and no one picks up! Next, the office is always crowded and over booked with patients, the receptionists behind the desk do not greet anyone that walks in and seem over worked, the doctors omg don't get me started they clearly are the type to not care about the patients they keep you waiting and when they finally see you they type on their computers the whole time and really don't make any attempt to care about what your medical concern is at the moment. You NEVER I mean NEVER see the same doctor you got about 5 different doctors diagnosing you with something different even though their laptops are opened with \"notes\" from the previous doctor visit. This place is horrible my husband is active duty military he needs real doctors to help him with whatever medical concern he has so he can continue to be healthy and defend these people everyday. Going back on the base where we have doctors who actually cares civilian doctors are horrible! And if I could rate this place lower than one star I would. Do not waste your time here find a clinic with a medical staff who truly cares for their patients!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Casandra M."}, {"timestamp": 1479765600, "content": "Ok, first off...doctors are actually pretty good. The problem lies with the staff. I do not know if the staff is lazy, overworked, or just plain incompetent. I've had to go to the office multiple times to get things done..such as prescription refills, insurance accepted or not, etc. Just this week, Walgreen tried contacting the medical center to renew pen needles for a diabetic. Of course, they couldn't get a hold of them on the phone. Seems the worst way to deal with these people is on the phone. Many times (actually most times) they don't even answer the phone. If you have a choice of another facility for your medical needs, I highly recommend you look into it.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Keith W."}]}
