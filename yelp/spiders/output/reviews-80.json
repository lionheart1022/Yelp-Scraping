You wait even with an appointment, I'm usually a walk in so it's understandable but still only see Awan for maybe 5 minutes. The reception is beyond rude. You NEVER get multiple refills on any prescriptions so you have to call and wait on the phone forever to get and and worst case scenario even if you've just been seen the week before will make you come in and pay for an office visit when they know you're unemployed but also have health insurance so he can see you for a few minutes to only give you one more month. The shortest refill of medication I've gotten from him, which is also the most helpful is only 10 days. I just called for a refill because my appointment with my other doctor had to be rescheduled and he flat out refused even after knowing it's the only thing that's made a difference in my day to day life short term. To sum it up all they want your money and don't care about your actual wellbeing whatsoever. None of my concerns are ever taken seriously. I will not be returning.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Sarah O."}, {"timestamp": 1525813200, "content": "I was a patient for 6 going to 7 years, then I get told they can't see me anymore, and when I asked if they had any recommendations, knew a website, or anything to help me find a new primary, I get told \"No, and your prescription is up front\".

They don't give a dang about your time or individual needs. They act like you are lucky to spend 4 to 5 hours sitting in the waiting area after your appointment time to be seen. On top of the wait, you sit in the room for another hour just so that they can check your blood pressure and send in your prescription.

I've checked with the receptionist and she has informed me that there were 3 people ahead of me... So I wait. \u00a0It has now been 3.5hours and I check with the receptionist again... Still 3 people??? This facility seems very unorganized and preoccupied with personal lives instead of business. Not to mention there is no air conditioning that seems to be on... Just a couple rotating fans. I have to say this is the worst experience I have had to deal with at a doctors office. \u00a0I will update this after I see the Doctor or choose to leave since not sure that will ever happen!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/BrahS_rXEmVz-O_HjMct3g/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Brian K."}, {"timestamp": 1490648400, "content": "We have been seeing Dr Rasool for years and I am always amazed how pleasant and efficient his staff is.

I have been a patient here for more than 4 years and I like my DR.. He is a good listener and also an Internal Medicine DR -- Staff can be rude sometimes due to they are somewhat young but the staff have been the same since I have been a patient there so I guess turnover rate is low.. They have decreased staff but no one new coming in.. My copay is only $15 so thats a plus.. Speaking of it I need to make an appt for my 6 months blood check up!

I'm a patient of Dr. Rasool's. He is an excellent doctor and I feel completely comfortable here. He has quickly diagnosed things that the emergency room misdiagnosed. The only problem with this place is that it is extremely busy and even if you make an appointment you still have to wait AT LEAST an hour. If you are sick and don't make an appointment? Plan on being here literally all day. My last visit was about 2 weeks ago and I had an appointment and still waited 2 hours. And scheduling appointments is also a pain because the receptionists don't like to answer their phones after lunch, so you have to call early in the morning when they open. They have this online schedule thing but it never works. I think they clearly over-book appointments and/or take too many walk-ins which makes everyone's wait longer. If they fixed those issues I'd give them 5 stars.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/t4U-d5muxF7yIGzUS8KvhA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 4, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Heather K."}]}
