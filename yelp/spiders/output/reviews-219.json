Many of us that face steep medical costs on insurance end up going self-pay. I have been going to Dr. Macool for a few years. Everything changed in January when he changed his management structure. We had call to make an appointment and were quoted a price for self-pay. It was in line with what was paid the last time so we booked the appointment. The day of the appointment when at the the doctors office, we were told a different higher price. We explained that what we were told and that the person on the phone did mention she was new and had to ask peers questions to help us. Although this conversation did happen, the staff member lied and the manager office; John backed her misrepresentation and would not honor anything said. It is clear to see has truly taken the Hippocratic oath and who is now all about the mighty dollar. There are better doctors and staff to be found in the area. Do yourself a favor, think twice about going here.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Michael L."}]}
