My how that seems like such a long time ago. Now his wife Dr Elizabeth is on board and some new Nurse Practitioners and a Physician Assistant. I could not be more thrilled with the level of care I have recieved here... The new PA Mr. Wilson aka \"Justin\" as he likes to be called is awesome. His bedside manner is excellent and he really cares about the patients, not just pushing you out the door. He is a great addition to the Biggers Practice...  \u00a0 As for the receptionists I have never had a problem.. I do see them being mistreated all the time and they are just as courteous as can be while having a smile on their face. If someone treated me like that I'd go off in a heartbeat, so I respect them a lot. People only see things one sided but I am here to tell u that Dr Biggers and his staff deserve the upmost respect.

They are rude, lack a personality, and far from empathetic. Definitely not a staff that should work in any doctors office. However once you get past the ugly... the people that work in the back office is so pleasant, friendly, warm and welcoming. I am a new patient at this practice and if it wasn't for Brandi being there I would be gone already! If you are looking for a medical professional that has a GREAT personality, and a great attitude, and what appears to be great practices, see Brandi! The Doctors at this office may very well be amazing but I have not seen them... lastly if you ever need blood drawn, Yolanda is the person to do it, I am terrified of needles and her attitude, sense of humor, and assurance is all you need to have your blood drawn comfortably.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PyfV7EUlwbIi5QH7_Dy_Ew/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 2, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Chris B."}, {"timestamp": 1488924000, "content": "Dr. Joel and Dr. Elizabeth are great, however their office staff is very rude and disrespectful.

He was rude, arrogant, \u00a0and felt his time far more valuable than mine. \u00a0So back to the drawing board, \u00a0I came across Dr. Joel. I took a chance and while we may not have hit it off personality wise, \u00a0( he's very nice just unique ) I quickly realized he was a true physician. He cares about his patients and doing what is best for them. He took over 3 hours of his day that day to help me out, \u00a0a virtual stranger. \u00a0He went above and beyond what most any other physician would even have bothered to do. \u00a0He was honest, \u00a0direct, \u00a0and unapologetic for doing things the right way. \u00a0Patients don't need to hear what they want to hear, \u00a0or to be placated, or to have some distorted version of the truth given to them. No, \u00a0patients need an honest, \u00a0ethical, \u00a0straight forward, \u00a0compassionate physician. I'm not looking for a best friend, \u00a0I'm looking for and honest physician who advocates for his patients, \u00a0who advocates for what is right and just, and that's exactly what I found in Dr. Joel.

For being my family doctor, they sure don't care about seeing their patients when they need an appointment (and I rarely need an appointment). It doesn't matter if you're in pain and only have a very limited time frame that you can actually secure childcare. They will not work with you, the least. They are always booked full and getting seen is impossible. Or maybe it's, just because I'm on state insurance and they don't want to take too many of those kind of patients? Regardless I feel with their lack of service and poor scheduling my health is being affected. Also the majority of the receptionist are rude. They have heavy attitudes and are quick to get you off the phone. I need to find a new family doctor and I suggest you look else where if you actually want to be seen, not to mention the 3 month waiting period to get in if you're a new patient.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/IEAl6Ix8Yo5T4tMHF7NE0w/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Laura W."}, {"timestamp": 1461877200, "content": "This review is purely for the front staff. I called to book an appt as a new patient. She answers and I ask if they are accepting new patients (as my insurance website listed them as), she rudely told me to hold and I'm pretty sure I heard her eyes actually roll. I held for about 2 minutes and when she came back, she said (again, with the attitude as if I was interrupting something more important) \"what was the question?\". I repeated myself, she put me on hold again, and at this point I was pretty sure I didn't want to even make the appointment because of her lack of professionalism - if just a simple question was this hard, what could I expect from actually having to deal with appointments and billing? When she came back, less than 30 seconds later, so at least it was a short hold, she said \"yeah, we are. But no new appointments until June\" with such contempt I wondered if I had personally offended her! I just thanked her and hung up. I'm okay with waiting (i actually made an appt else where and it's not until July), but the utter lack of respect for a complete stranger and potential new patient, was uncalled for. I'm sure they have lost plenty of business because of the front staff. I honestly would have given a 1 star, but since I didn't actually meet with the doctor, I didn't want to totally drag down her rating, so I figured 3 was a good split.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/KSLrPwS3LVAbJj7AeNKSjg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 3, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jennifer J."}, {"timestamp": 1450648800, "content": "I selected Biggers Family Medicine as my primary care when I enrolled in Humana at the beginning of 2015.
