I made arrangements to leave work early, because they don't see new patients after 5pm. My appointment was for 4:30, I arrived at 4:20. Christine at the desk asked if I brought my welcome packet w/me. I said no. & I asked her if they rec'd my medical records. She gave me the welcome packet on a clipboard for me to fill out and said you may not be able to be seen today, we left a message on your answer machine last night, to come in at 4 and bring this packet. I told her sorry, \u00a0I didn't listen to any messages. Christine said she will ck w/the staff in the back to see if I can still \u00a0be seen. I asked her to let them know that I have been waiting over a month for this appointment, left work early, and I'm not feeling good.. 5 minutes later, as I'm on the last page of the welcome packet, \u00a0Christine told they are not going to be able to see me. Do I want to reschedule? (Thier office was empty and they were suppose to be open until 6:00.) . The doctor maybe great, along with rest of his staff, \u00a0I will never know thanks to Christine an unprofessional health care fake.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Shari P."}, {"timestamp": 1438808400, "content": "Pure incompetence! \u00a0Couldn't refil my prescription after 3 days. \u00a0Appearently too busy for my medical needs. \u00a0I'm glad I'm not elderly, or I'd probably be dead now. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and find a more caring medical practice some place else.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "D D."}]}
