{"external_system_unique_id": 21, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1530565200, "content": "I tried to find a primary doctor in close proximity to my home and thought I'd give Dr. Cemelus a chance. . This place is ghetto and as unprofessional as it gets. The front desk staff lacks professionalism and doesn't seem to have an understanding of what the hell is going on or how to effectively get their jobs done. I arrived at 11:00am for an appointment at 11:15am. Ahead of me in line was a woman complaining about not receiving test results for blood work that was previously done--no one had discussed the results or anything with her. A few minutes go by, and the receptionist finally gives her a copy of the results, another staff member briefly looks it over and tells the patient that everything is negative. OK? Is that how you properly inform a patient? In front of everyone? Anyway, I eventually sign in. As I do, the receptionist finally acknowledges my existence and asks for identification and insurance ID. I give them to her and she gives me New Patient Forms to fill out. I take a seat and begin filling the forms out. I'm sitting away from the front counter and the receptionist announces that my copay is $30, aloud. What the hell? Why are you announcing that to everyone? You're supposed to wait until I return my paperwork to let me know anything like that. Furthermore, she was wrong. I didn't have a copay because this visit counted toward my annual physical exam, which she should've known because that's what I told them when I booked the appointment. . It gets worse. . I am then called to the back office by what I presume to be a nurse. She asks a lot of questions and then asks what drugs I was on. I started listing the drugs, then she asks how to spell them. Aren't you a nurse? You should know that better than me. On top of that, you're using a software that auto-populates the prescriptions. She asks if I have any children twice, and I tell her no both times. It made me feel uncomfortable, like people like me almost always have children or something. . But hold on, it gets worse. . Finally, I am called in by Dr. Cemelus and he goes over the notes that were previously inputted by the nurse. He asks me the reason for my visit and I tell him I'm here for a routine physical and also need blood work done. He begins his examination, and then his phone rang. He paused and excused himself to answer his phone--in the middle of an examination?! Then he asks me if I have children (maybe to start small talk), but he could already see by the nurse's notes that I do not have children. He asks why don't I have children or if I don't want children now or ever, I tell him, \"not now, probably not ever, they're too expensive.\" His response is something to the effect of, \"Well, you can just have a child and get the government to take care of it like everyone else.\" What the h--? That is extremely offensive and extremely classist. I understand his office is located in the middle of Pine Hills, but to just draw that conclusion is disgusting. . I have lab work to get done at Quest, and I will go, but I don't think I'll ever return to this practice. I'll send the results over to my OB/GYN all the way in Hunter's Creek and have her come up with a treatment plan if necessary. Sometimes when you want exceptional service, you have to travel far away from home, and it looks like that is what I'll have to continue doing.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Sdc9ER0VyL2FqLAnJl5-hQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Tenieka H."}, {"timestamp": 1528923600, "content": "I wish there was an option to give zero, because this is what I'd give this joke of a clinic!
