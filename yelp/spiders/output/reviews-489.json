They have been there for me every time I need medical attention. They are there for me on weekends and I can walk in without an appointment. Dr. Ahmed is soft spoken. The staff are very kind and attentive. And, last but not least, more reasonable cost wise than most other physicians especially when one doesn't have insurance like me. I am a healthier person because of this clinic.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/j1a3rNOQYVj4h_WS7G3X-A/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Leslie Y."}, {"timestamp": 1464123600, "content": "Dr Ahmed is not interested in anything except Medicare. He listens, but, is not concerned for you after you leave the office. I started to see him in June of 2015. He had me coming in every 30 days to fill my prescriptions and billing Medicare for a weight loss program to justify this. $200 plus $85 every month to them. I needed a referral to an orthopedic, he said \"drive down Mason Ave. there's one on either side.\" I needed a mammogram, he wanted to do a complete physical, (?) bill Medicare, and never told me where to go to get one done. I figured it out. I had been taking Tramadol for back pain and after over 2 years he literally waved me off and told me to find a pain clinic which I did on my own. I now have a REAL doctor that is not only taking care of me but is saving me money. Don't waste your money on him. Go to the emergency room instead. His bathrooms are a mess.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_9P1RH2BbP6KCbtABlWaiQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Betsy G."}, {"timestamp": 1481493600, "content": "Terrible.

First thing he asked me before discussing my problems was who is going to pay for this. I was shocked never had an issue with my military insurance ever. As I tried to discuss my headaches with him he interrupted and was extremely rude to me and told me to go back to the ER. this doctor is very unprofessional, rude and does not care. I've lived all over the world and have never experienced a doctor this bad. I was treated better at the emergency room and found out there are many other complaints about him.

Lots of changeovers in staffing and he's always late. If the office opens at 9 am you can expect to wait at least 30 minutes for him to show up. He doesn't listen, \u00a0takes phone calls during a consultation (although there are signs that his patients are not permitted to use their cell phones). Leaves the room without providing adequate information regarding follow up or instructions. My husband has a problem with his blood pressure. I tried explaining what the problem was with the higher dosage of medication the doctor prescribed which was causing his blood pressure to drop and my husband to experience dizziness. The doctor didn't want to listen to this. Apparently he loves to just prescribe medication but really doesn't want to take \u00a0the time to adequately listen or review the medication choices. I tried calling the office today when my husband's blood pressure dropped significantly on the high dosage he's prescribed - the doctor wouldn't come to the phone. Initially he was busy with a patient but I heard him finish and I was then told we'd have to come in for a consultation. I was also told that it was more than likely our blood pressure machine in a very condescending tone. This is highly unlikely as it's the same machine we use for my blood pressure and that's reading is very constant. I would definitely think long and hard before suggesting this physician. I really could care less that he speaks other language fluently either. This is America and in America we speak English.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jolande C."}, {"timestamp": 1474405200, "content": "I had an appointment for 9 am (apparently the time the open) and the secretary was late. Three others were seen before me. I waited for an hour and a half before I had to leave for work...without even seeing the Dr. yet. I was told that if I came back I would have priority and when I came back two others were seen before me and I waited another hour and a half before I was seen. I just recently moved and needed a prescription in which the Dr. would not honor without outside recommendation from a specialist. He then patronized me with side effects and creeped me out when he called me a \"good girl\" and patted my shoulder several times. He ran tests I did not go in for and said he needed them before prescribing (Ive had the prescription my whole life and never did them before) and insisted upon cleaning my ears even after I said I didn't like it because he claimed I didn't know how great it was. I felt violated and belittled, ultimately walking out with ear aches and without my prescription.
