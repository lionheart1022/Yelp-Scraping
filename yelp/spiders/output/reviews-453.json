Finally, if this is not enough detail, and my review gets erased again, I will be more than happy to continue to finesse my review to contain more and more details of my horrible experience until yelp accepts it, because I have a right to warn others about my particular very poor experience with this practice so that they can find a better doctor, which is the point of reviews. \u00a0You asked for more detail? \u00a0Your wish is my command. \u00a0Skip this doctor.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/O0h9n6lKaM2R6e24weqzsA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "M R."}, {"timestamp": 1431896400, "content": "I first saw Dr Nadia Hanna when she was with First Physicians Group and really enjoyed her thoroughness and kindness. When I learned that she had finally opened her own private practice as Sarasota Primary Care (. ), I was so happy for her. I highly recommend Dr Hanna to anyone looking for an excellent, caring Primary Care Physician, as I saw her today and can attest that she is alive and well and in a very nice new office at 3333 Clark Rd.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "L D M."}]}
