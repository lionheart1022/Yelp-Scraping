I have a rare birth defect so as a new patient I always get nervous going to a new doctor. He went above and beyond for me. He spends actual time with his patients and will figure out the best solution instead of just a bandaid per say. His staff is amazing and genuinely cares.

My whole family uses this office except now he wont take my little sister just because he cant handle the truth for making her wait 2 hours to get a refill.
