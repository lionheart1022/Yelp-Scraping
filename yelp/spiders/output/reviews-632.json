They have a policy of a $100 missed appt fee, however when I signed the girl explained that if you cancel the day before or first thing in the morning for an evening appt it didn't apply. I should have read the document better, because it says you have to cancel 5 days ahead or get charged $100. I cancelled an appt 8hrs before the appt time and was charged, the receptionist told me it was voided 2 days later but it was not. So I disputed with my credit card company (they also make you give credit card upfront as a new patient) I initially got the refund but has since been overturned because they submitted the 5 day letter. So much for don't worry about it and it's been voided. I'll not be back", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lu0fhnfuuP11GyZeAt8_Ug/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 2, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Christina B."}]}
