Doctor got lots of Medicaid patients, and she had them come back each month for medications that could be refilled, it appears so she could charge additional office visit fees.. Shouted at the top of her lungs that I was addicted to a narcotic pain medication I have never been prescribed nor even ever taken, then looked at my chart, realized her mistake, looked embarrassed, and wrote me a prescription for a narcotic pain medication.
