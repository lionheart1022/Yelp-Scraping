Unfortunately this establishment has the most unprofessional staff, just awful!! I have been a patient at this establishment for about 5 years and today I realized how much I was NOT cared for, valued and respected. Two weeks ago I went to this office due to heavy coughs, I am not a smoker, thick mucus and fever. I was given prescriptions, by the nurse practitioner, for coughing, ONLY. 3 days later I went back due to no change to my condition and this time the nurse practitioner prescribed a weak antibiotics for seven days and now 2 weeks later not much has changed. I call the office and they recommended a chest X-Ray and when I went back they wanted to charge me for another visit. So 3 times in almost 2 weeks for the same sickness and they wanted to charge me for another office visit and refused to wave the fees. When I had an objection, the defensive staff did not hold back and advised me to go to another clinic if I did not like it. Suddenly there were 4 to 5 other nurses who were not even a part of the conversation I was having with the receptionist and all united, with complete unprofessional attitude started making uncalled comments.\"This is our clinic, if you don't like it you can go somewhere else\" then the receptionist refunded the $70.00 I had paid as the office visit, yes I paid the fee, and told me the nurse practitioner was not going to see me and that I should go somewhere else. No doctor on the premises, no office manager, no one in charge to take over and stop the staff who had teamed up against your customer, your patient who your team should only focus on caring for, and healing their condition. Doctor Patel, it is too bad you were not there to see your staff's unacceptable behavior. If a patient comes to your office 3 times in 10 days for the same sickness, one that your providers have not been able to diagnose, it would not be a bad idea to wave the office visit fee!! Also in a situation like this your patients frustration should not be a surprise to your staff, and being defensive is NOT the way they should behave. I do give an A+ to your team for sticking to each other and kicking your patient out of your office. They certainly do work as a team!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/K7C2Y8yAbiW3aQYYZIn2YA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Ramtin K."}, {"timestamp": 1509746400, "content": "After 1 hour waiting they told my that my insurance is not accepted by them, the receptionist is very bad don't have an idea of customer service!! .
