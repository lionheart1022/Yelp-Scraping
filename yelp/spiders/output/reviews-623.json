They don't have a proper answering service during off hours, they are only there in the mornings on Wednesday and Friday so if you need to make an appointment or ask a billing question you have to call back because you could leave a message but they'll never return your call. I have to call over and over again to remind them that I need a refill sent for my prescription. When you call to ask a question about anything the person that would normally answer that question is never available. Now they have a phone tree that doesn't work. You push the appropriate number and it then just hangs up in you even though it says you should start leaving a message which of course if you did would never be returned anyway. \u00a0Then I had a scan, the nurse never called me back with the results then I called her and she said it was fine. Three months later I have an appointment with the doctor and he said that he did want to discuss the results of the scan. Then I call to ask for a receipt to send to my FSA, and I have to call ten times in a row until the stupid phone tree lets me through to someone then that person says they can't email or fax the receipt to me....I guess because they are so behind the times that they don't have an email address but they make some privacy excuse up. So they have to snail mail it to me. Good gawd it's 2018, people. And the staff don't seem to understand that I am asking for a copy of a receipt to send to my FSA. Seriously this is not rocket science. I'm done trying with this place. I'll probably have to call back again next week to ask for my receipt by snail mail again since I have little confidence they'll remember to send it the first time.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Abby B."}, {"timestamp": 1406235600, "content": "This doctor is definitely not for everyone. My appointment with Dr. Cruz was perhaps the worst experience I have ever had dealing with a healthcare professional. I make it a point to be as fair and reasonable as possible when writing a review, so I can say that my experience may have even been unique to the care that others have received. The office staff is very friendly and accommodating, but during my experience with Dr. Cruz, he was extremely uncomfortable, abrasive, confrontational, and didn't take the time to listen to anything I had to say in regard to my symptoms. His judgmental disposition and tone when referring to my previous medical history was intentionally hostile. I would not recommend this practice to anyone.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/8Y6py66FglatTN8ROQudAg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jessica P."}, {"timestamp": 1453672800, "content": "I do not recommend this doctor to anyone. He is the most awkward, uncomfortable Doctor I have ever been to. After bringing my fianc\u00e9e here for a visit, he jumped to the weirdest conclusions and diagnosis with the symptoms we were explaining. We had to go else where to get a second opinion and boy am I glad we did. He is ALWAYS late. I plan on switching doctors as soon as possible. The only reason I've managed to stay with this office for as long as I have is because of the staff. I can't stress this enough.
