I was waiting on hold hour and I was an hour late for work. This place is super on organize and should not have to make their patients wait and After I was called in I was just moved over into a room to wait another 20 minutes for knowing to see me. I finally had enough and I walked out without a doctor saying at all. I am beyond pissed and none of this was worth my time.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/eu75lSa3QA91JPu71Wwt9w/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Solice D."}, {"timestamp": 1514239200, "content": "They will invent illness for you so you can buy their products which are pretty expensive. Once you visit them again they will tell you tour condition is something else, so they can \"prescribe\" another or their to\u00f3 expensive and unverified \"medication\" in fact that is trash they are selling. They will also prescribe medication you don't really need so that when you feel the horribles side effects, you can come back to their office, so they can bill the insurance. No matter if you don't have a health condition, they will try to create one for you by giving you a bunch of differents pills that you don't really need. They also keep calling you to remind about apointments that you never requested. Be careful with them.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "GeeGee G."}, {"timestamp": 1503435600, "content": "Highly unprofessional, extremely inconsistent, and rude. They will make you wait hours each time. 4 visits and it took no less than 2 hours each time of just waiting. Saw 2 different doctors and they both answer staff questions constantly during the short time they are with you. No follow through after doctor leaves the room. Doctor completely contradicted herself multiple times. Doesnt listen at all.
