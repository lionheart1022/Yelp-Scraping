My dad was a bit on the heavier side but didn't have any heart issues or anything. Got a sudden onset of diabetes. Instead of looking into it further the doctor pushed it aside and said oh it's your weight that's causing it. That was over a year ago. Fast forward to March of this year. My dad goes to doctor with back pain and doctor says oh maybe if you lost your gut you're back wouldn't hurt. They finally decide to send him in for a ct scan. Ct scan comes back. The same male doctor very cold heartedly says oh you've got stage 4 pancreatic cancer. You have up to a year to live. Then leaves the room. Doesn't answer questions. Showed no concern whatsoever. My dad died this August. I truly believe if they had looked into it more when he first got diagnosed with diabetes they would have caught the cancer sooner then maybe they could have done more. I also intend to look into anything I can do to make sure this so called doctor doesn't treat anybody else like that again.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ApwuwNTlN01vFdpZnllCdg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Katelyn G."}, {"timestamp": 1473109200, "content": "The Doctor and the PA and the medical staff are wonderful, however I have never been treated so badly by the office staff, Stephanie was very rude and did not make my visit into this office welcoming. \u00a0I will continue to come back because I have a history with the doctor and the staff, but I want to let people who have not established a medical professional that if you want to be treated like a valued patient by the office, choose another office.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/z5njwD-XYwPcZxMF-fWs6g/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Sue B."}, {"timestamp": 1473368400, "content": "I have been to this Medical office twice I was seen by Carol what a wonderful doctor I really like her But she really needs to teach the front desk staff Manners they are so unprofessional and rude I never seen a front desk staff so rude at a Doctors office the Hispanic woman The African American woman now they have a white woman and guess what they all need to learn Matters and Customer Service skills their they are Horrible they don't even look at you when they talk and when they talk to you they look away and start to talk to their co-worker and don't even finish with you hate the Front desk staff Fire them.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Thea S."}]}
