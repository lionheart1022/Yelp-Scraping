I went to them recently and Dr. Kamara said I had cellulitis. After a week I was still having symptoms. Dr. Kamara and Idicula would not see me so I went to the ER. Good thing I questioned the diagnosis. It turns out I had DVT which can kill you!!! I was treated for it at the hospital and okay now. Have to say these are not my doctors anymore!!!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/P1gs8cX2ZpI5L4exhfMa6Q/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Mitch L."}]}
