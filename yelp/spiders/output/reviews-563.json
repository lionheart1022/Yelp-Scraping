Him and his wife are super nice and even get you in same day if your sick. Some of the negative comments are not true but i guess people want to give bad reviews because they are internet trolls and have nothing else better to do. By the way I see a user who is complaining about \u00a0getting a drug test every month.FYI if you are not aware of the new laws that primary care doctors cant prescribe certain medication and they have to drug test to Protect their license.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/X1gJ3FXYdCW8k-KusERUWQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Elizabeth F."}, {"timestamp": 1508706000, "content": "Do not go to this doctor if you are looking to be treated for common family practice medical concerns like ADHD. \u00a0I've never dealt with a doctor as difficult as Dr. Charles and I've lived in 8 different states and seen multiple providers. Even with 16 years of documented medical history I was interrogated by the doctor to prove my condition. The next appointment with the doctor was not bad, however when I needed to come back the following month for a Rx refill When I ran out of medication they canceled my apt (the day of) and said I couldn't be seen as more than 30 days had past, I've never had that problem before EVER. . This practice is very good with availability, you can schedule the day of and practically be seen, however if you decide to reschedule the day of (and you made your apt that day) they charge you the most ridiculous amount of \"no show fee\" of $50, and beware they will also cancel on you as well. I had a 7:30 apt I scheduled 2 days prior and they called me the day of at 6:53 am saying not to come in because it had been more than 30 days since I had my last Rx refilled, I get there in the morning at my appointment time to talk to the doctor about it and he hadn't even shown up to the practice yet. . Expect drug tests every visit - I had no problem doing this, however I know not every provider will require you to do so, especially if you come every month for a Rx refill.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Nvut1TsHL1rCEWxctY27Lg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Emily G."}, {"timestamp": 1450303200, "content": "Warning!!!! Dr Talakkottur and TLC Aesthetics will BURN your face!!! I went to TLC on Oct 19, 2014 and purchase 3 IPL treatment. Having had IPL prior I immediately was concerned by the INTENSE pain. My concern was dismissed by Doctor Talakkottur and he continued the treatment. The results were burns all over my face, with large portions of my facial hair damaged. 4 weeks later I returned and the machine was now broken and doctor was too busy to see me. A week after that I went back for the 3rd time again the doctor was unavailable. If you want to read the whole thing please contact me arziona1976@hotmail. I have pictures of the damage to my face. I strongly recommend you avoid this place!!! Dr Talakkottur. I see you like to reply to these. I challenge you to contact me, ON AIR with the local TV new folks that recently contacted you. I would love to share all the pictures of the damage caused by your malpractice with the viewers across Tampa bay! .
