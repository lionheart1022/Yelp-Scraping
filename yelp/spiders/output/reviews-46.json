His name is Dr. Jose A Lopez Sure the people in the office was nice at first and yes they told me about the program but what they didn't tell me was how costly it was. They kept putting me on machine after machine without even letting me know how much it was going to be. I kept asking how much is this but all they kept saying is it's ok don't worry about it's free it's just a consultation. I decided not to go through with the program because it was way to much money I'm talking about over $800.00 a month.. Little did I know that they would bill me over $500.00, when I asked them why they said it was because of the doctor visit and because I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder. My response I'm sorry did I take the sleep disorder machine no I didn't their response we still have to bill you because we told you about it. One other thing be very careful when they are taking your blood pressure they will say you have high blood pressure when you really don't, problem is they are using the wrong cuff size.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Betty W."}]}
