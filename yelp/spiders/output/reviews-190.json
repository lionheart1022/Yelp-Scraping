Gave them my new insurance information. Went to the doctor's appointment. They recommended biopsying a spot on my skin. Said they would come back with a price because I had not yet met my deductible. When they came back in they said \"we're very sorry but we do not take this insurance\". I explained that they confirmed the insurance when I made the appointment. But no big deal I'll just pay out of pocket. They told me no they can't accept my cash because it's illegal. They could only do that if I had no insurance at all.

I have been going to him for a few years. He is a brilliant doctor. He is very kind and when it comes to his attention and knowledge of his patients and their needs, no one better! I was escorted in the room by a well mannered and respectful young lady named Portia. She was very good at her job and johnny on the spot assisting Dr. Bond with taking a biopsy on me today. Both she and Dr. Bond put me at ease. As for the check in staff I have no complaints there either. They do require your co-pay up front. But if you already know that amount, there should be no problem. The wait time is not exceptionally long.
