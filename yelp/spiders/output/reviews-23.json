{"external_system_unique_id": 23, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1529960400, "content": "I had an appointment at this location about 2 weeks ago and everything was fine! I called to make an appointment as a new patient amd the lady helping me was kind. When I went to the facility, things went smoothly. I was called in in a timely manner. The nurse was very nice and Dr. Janmeja was incredible. He spent a good 30mins talking to me and was very informative. I couldnt get labs done that day because it was too late (I'm assuming they don't do blood work after 12PM?), so I went a few days later to the Casselberry location to get it done. That was also quick and the phlebotimist was super nice.. The reason why I'm giving them a 4 out of 5 is because their phone system is AWFUL. The way it works is that there's only ONE phone center for all 8 locations. So you can't call a specific loaction to speak to them directly, you have to go through their phone operators in Sanford first. And because you have so many people trying to call one place, the line to wait to speak to someone is atrocious. I had to call several times because I live in Casselberry, not near the Alafaya location, so I could not drive over there to get my answers. And every time I've called, I had to wait 30+ minutes. AND THEN when they finally transferred me over, it took another 15-20mins for the receptionist in Alafaya to get a hold of me. I'm not sure why they do things like this, but it needs to change. I know they have an online system that patients can get a account and do stuff through there, however I was not informed that in order to get an account, you needed to make one while your at the office, which I think is stupid.. Money wise, this place is surprisingly cheap. They have a price scale that's dependent on how much you make and if you have insurance. My brother went a few years back and paid nothing to see the doctor. Their pharmacy locations are far from where I live, but I'd rather get some of my more expensive medications from there because some of them are way cheaper there than at any other pharmacy. For example, I have an asthma medication that would have costed me around $170 but only costed me $27 at their pharmacy.. I haven't experience anything overwhelmingly negative here. I do have another appointment coming up soon, so hopefully that goes well.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Cod98GrZTRP8fa4hdgy1Qg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 4, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Julie J."}, {"timestamp": 1529960400, "content": "Came for an annual well women's exam and after 2 hours was told I had to come back the following week to do my labs since it was late in the day. Was assured it would be quick since it was just a blood draw and was given an early morning appointment. After waiting for an hour I asked the receptionist what was taking so long she said the lab tech would be right out. 30 more minutes pass before the receptionist just walks me to the back. Guess what this bitch was doing!! on the computer looking at memes. And then I still ended up waiting another 10minutes till she finished. For a 30second blood draw I missed 2 days of work and spent 4 hours waiting for people to do their job..

Sometimes there's a wait on the phone, however, they have a great system that will return your call so you don't have to hold forever. The phlebotomist in the lab is wonderful.

Spoke to intake person, then spoke to dental Nurse Jessica, we talked a little and she gave me her ext. Ended up going to my ent next day. Since i have a trach and many dentist are afraid to sign off on the paperwork. My ent told to have anybody call him, that there is no problem getting anything done and for any dentist to call him. Went back to true health, Saw Jessica who thanked me for comming back. Then saw the dentist who apoligised for the confusion but had also worked in a hospital. Jessica and the Doc both took ownership and took exrays and did comprehensive. The Doc informed me , they dont do deepcleaning there and Jessica would help me find a dentist that would. Before she had a chance, i found a dentist that did it. Went back for 2 filling and found out three different dentists and 2 types of xrays did not reveal that 1 tooth needed to be pulled. They Jessica and the Doctor took incredibal care while filling the one tooth that could be done. I was in the chair 2 hours and they both made me feel so comfortable. Great team work. They dont pull teeth, but did a temp filling for the tooth that needs to be removed. They gave me a refereal just for the tooth extraction. Unfortunatly the doc is moving to north florida, but Jessie ia staying there. Once im cancer free I will go back for teeth cleaning. The staff was really fantastic that i dealth with. No apointnent to start the first tume , not a long wait time.. I will go back to have my teeth checked and cleaned. The doc was awesome. Jessica is beyond awesome. They told me step by step what had to be done. There main concern was that i was confortable while working on me and kept asking me :)", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Rick R."}, {"timestamp": 1502139600, "content": "Where do I start??

Oh btw I was only a walk in because my daughter's doctor left thier office and I didn't get a call or letter or anything! So now my daughter needs a booster shot and they won't take \"new patients\" until the end of the month. So we waited from 7:15 untill 8:30 when someone finally opened the door. I'm sitting in the waiting room and listening to how rude the front desk nurse is to everyone.. I will be looking for a new office.

The doctor I saw was Richardo Pascual in the Casselberry office. I went to this place one time and figured out rather quickly that they were the worst medical office I've ever been to. First, he tried to do an OBGYN check when I booked a regular doctor. Then the nurse told me to LIMIT my health problems because he couldn't deal with everything at one time. He did though so I guess the one star could be for that. However, I was sent for a growth that he called a tumor so any normal person would freak out about that. I got my MRI done on a Monday, they got the results on a Wednesday. I called Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and they said \"Sorry, the doctor hasn't looked at your results yet.\" With a promise to call back Friday at the latest. Never called. So of course I freak out all weekend. I actually called this place and left voicemails all the next week with no return. Finally talked to a lady in charge who promised call backs 3 times with nothing. I finally got ahold of someone on week 3 with a referral that they tried to snail mail to me instead of just sending via fax. Their radiologist said my tumor was inflamed and infected. After getting multiple second looks, every other doctor said it was definitely \u00a0not inflamed and infected. They ended up snail mailing me so I couldn't get a doctor to look at my tumor for 3 weeks. This place is a disgusting excuse for a doctor's office and they should be closed down as fast as possible.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/LteHMGbRi0nTO8jZ_nYUDQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Olivia Q."}]}
