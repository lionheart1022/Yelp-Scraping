{"external_system_unique_id": 59, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1535230800, "content": "Dr Kraucak is one of the most thorough MD's I've met. He mixes Western,. holistic, longevity and also does stem cell treatments among numerous other modalities in which he is well trained. I went to get a physical and wow! He checks everything & integrates years of knowledge in one exam. If you go, there may be times when you have to wait longer than you expect but I accept that he's being very thorough with all his patients. It would be worth your time to just stop by and see the list of treatments they offer. Massage, acupuncture, lymph drainage, nutrition, various infusions and they even have great supplements that may help keep us all off the toxic pharmaceuticals we see on TV. The staff is very courteous too. The office is easy to find and well kept. Dr K also offers presentations regarding the risk and benefits of the numerous treatments. He is one of the most qualified MD's in the area and I wish we could clone him. I have seen him at least 10 times and I assure you this is a doc you can trust plus I have watch other docs around this area and it seems many just do a once over and send you back to the pasture to graze till your over & done! I want to make the most out of the 4th quarter of life and enter the end zone of the game knowing I'm all used up and didn't waste one life unit. Insurance covers visits, labs etc. When choosing some of the cutting edge modalities I find insurance companies prefer only to cover older medicines and procedures to save money not provide the best/safest and beneficial care. If I could afford it I'd be there every week optimizing my health. That's all for now.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/3NMU7a8ZON_PgbtRvYyIuA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Seeker B."}]}
