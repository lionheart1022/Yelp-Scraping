I have been waiting over two months for my glasses. I called. The gentleman said there was a pricing issue. I don't even know what that means. I give it five stars because of the other departments. It is very good health care here. And actually the eye doctor, is super Duper awesome. I just have that one issue with the department that dispenses the glasses. it is run by a private company. This is why I don't want our government privatizing any of the VA. Listen, you will at times wait a while to be seen, you will get good health care, but you won't get a $900 bill.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/KwdaHfnU6Rkn4D4QdhPdsQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Dave D."}, {"timestamp": 1502312400, "content": "Tough to rate. If you can ever get to an actual health provider, the care is marginal. However, it took a FULL YEAR to get an appointment. They refuse to give referrals to specialists. They have incompetent PA\"s claiming to be MD\"s. It took one nurse three try's to get a simple blood pressure reading. If at all possible, use another facility, don't go to this one. If you must go here be very vigilant about anything they do or say.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Stephen K."}]}
