Dr. Rodriguez is professional and thorough, and has a very warm personality. Dixie is very effective and has helped me through numerous insurance issues. Mayra is attentive and my vitals are always taken properly, and she gets my prescriptions sorted out; her time management skills are top notch. They take many different insurances, and they are Family Practice, so they take adult patients as well. I've never been handed off to a Nurse Practitioner here, as happens at other doctor's offices so often, so if I can be taken care of in the office they do not do unnecessary referrals.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jZOmjLBKxIxK9EJrZRNpng/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Richard L."}, {"timestamp": 1525381200, "content": "The front office staff and the Office Manager are horrible.

He is not the problem it is his staff I'm not even sure he know how bad they are.

My baby was given a vaccination without my authorization after I requested that that they not give it to her, see my Google review--I don't even feel like discussing it.
