She was my mother's primary care physician and after she was hospitalized for a month and I called her office to get updates, she had her nurse return my call and then never called me or my mother again to follow up. Both Mease Continuing Care and Mease hospital said it was not the first time they had heard patients complain about her neglectfulness. . My mother has been complaining about her for years and thank god she now has another doctor.. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T GO SEE THIS WOMAN. Horrible follow up and she does not follow up with her patients--even those that are hospitalized.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/16cct5f5Xoz1b782a41ecg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Surfer Girl S."}, {"timestamp": 1482357600, "content": "This doctor treated me in the hospital. \u00a0I never spoke to her once but her nurse practitioner. \u00a0On the last day of my hospital visit she started screaming my medications and information from the nurses station where everyone could hear. \u00a0She forced me to rush my diverticulitis recovery and cost me two days extra in the hospital against the advice of her own nurse practitioner. \u00a0She is the worst doctor I have every experienced in my lifetime. \u00a0Stay away!!! \u00a0Beware!!!!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Michelle M."}]}
