Several times the office staff has made mistakes that resulted in me having to come back in, resulting in additional copays. \u00a0I.e. one nurse argued when I said the Dr. Needed urine, causing me to have to come back. \u00a0. Doctor spent no more than 5 min with me each visit and seemed reluctant to diagnose. \u00a0Long wait times and office staff discuss other patients right next to the waiting room. . For the amount I pay my insurance company the quality of service was a let down.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Fa5inrtky0YyMjxcwPWMRQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Johnny K."}]}
