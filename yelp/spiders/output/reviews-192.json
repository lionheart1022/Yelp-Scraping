I need an annual physical each year, and I have a program that keeps track to make sure I don't miss one. I scheduled 6 months in advance my annual appointment. I arrive there is no copay as its covered. Talk to dr, he listens to my heart and sends me to labs. Normal annual visit, less than a month later I get a copay bill as they never codeded it as my annual. I ask for review they said basically sorry you owe the copay even though you told everyone it was your annual, and was told to make another appointment to do the exact same thing again, and this time they will code it my annual. Not only wasting money my insurance has to pay to you a 2nd time, but also the office, staff, labs and doctors time to do exactly what we did last month, with no change on my part. Just so it will show I had my annual. This is in my opinion a way to make extra money off my insurance company and a horrible way to do business.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Kristin H."}, {"timestamp": 1511906400, "content": "Two weeks ago my husband began having a stabbing pain in the right side of his face. \u00a0It was so severe, he thought he was having an aneurysm. We decided to go to SRMC ER at 8:30pm that night. \u00a0The waiting room was pretty full but we weren't able to discern who was waiting for care and who was family/friends. \u00a0Almost 6HOURS LATER, after having been triaged with a pain index of 7-10 out of 10, he was seen by an ER doc. The Dr. ordered a head CT with contrast and an IV for fluids and pain meds. The nurse wasn't very good at inserting the IV tube and got blood everywhere! It looked like a murder scene. She had to clean him up. \u00a0The only really competent employee was Allison in CT. \u00a0She took care of getting me a more comfortable chair and was very pleasant and good at her job! . 11 hours later, with a diagnosis of Trigeminal Neuralgia, he was released and we went to Charlotte Medical Center and hour and a half away. \u00a0. Hospital ER is horrible. It was a busy night but my husband was in intense pain for 6 hours before he even saw a Dr.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dZT8SPFtx9_eUrGl4UJQJw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Tati M."}, {"timestamp": 1515621600, "content": "If i could give 0 stars i would. By far the worst hospital I've ever been to. I sat in the waiting room for 3 1/2 hrs. I finally get to the room and had to explain my situation 3 different times to 3 different nurses. They ended up testing me for something didn't even go there for and then had to wait another 1 1/2 for the test to come back. They ended up rolling my bed in the hallway and just leaving me there. I couldn't believe it. I asked one of the nurses for a discharge because at that point, clearly I wasn't going to get anything accomplished with them. they said they had to find my nurse and that took another 30mins. Everything came back ok. I left that hospital still not knowing why I had the symptoms I had when I first got there. I would NOT recommend this hospital to anyone. They should rename it \"killer county\"", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Breayna W."}, {"timestamp": 1421186400, "content": "By far the worst medical facility of all time. \u00a0Bathrooms in the ER were dirtier then a gas station facility..

The nurses do not communicate with each other. It took me hours just to get a glass of water after I asked for one 4 different times. I was told I would be given Tylenol every 4 hours to manage my fever and severe aches and pains but they forgot and ended up making me wait 8 hours even though I reminded them several times. I was having bad chills and shivering due to my fever and asked for blankets 3 times before they brought me one paper thin blanket that was basically a bed sheet. Once I fell asleep at some time in the night they came into my room and turned my air conditioning on high. I woke up shivering violently and asked them if they could turn it off. They instead turned it to medium. I was not allowed more than one pillow. They forgot to give me an id bracelet so I was without an id bracelet until the middle of the night when I had to ask for one myself. I could keep going but you get the picture.
