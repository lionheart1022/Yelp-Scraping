They have no personable skills at all, probably cheap help. \u00a0Always want patients to come in for prescription refills, supposedly due to a new federal law. Not true at all several people I know have thec EXACT same prescriptions I have and are required to see their dr once every six months, not every three months, another price gouging office. Do not go here, it's a waste of time and money.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/L0rQDbKqotZ1szauzj7vOg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Christine A."}]}
