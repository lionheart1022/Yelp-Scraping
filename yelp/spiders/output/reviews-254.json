My fever came down to normal and I was discharged in about 2 hours. I was given 3 prescriptions when I left.

Here we are again. I've dealt with Incompetent nurses that were unable to answer what I think are basic questions about my mother's diagnosis and possible causes for the drop in chemicals in her body, the lack of concern about how she's positioned in the bed ( mother is contracted and don't talk), not being turned in a timely manner since she has terrible stage 4 wounds on both her hips which she received from a hospital for the same reasons...not changing her and turning her in a timely manner. I came in this evening and told first shift nurse continually that I smelled poop and her response was, \"it's not the sheets because we just washed her 90 minutes ago\", \u00a0but she never checked my mother to see if she needed cleaning again. I decided to check her because the smell continued to air the room and realized my mother needed cleaning so I cleaned her up and changed her. After cleaning her up, I sat for a while and continued to smell the poop, but unable to determine where it was coming from. It was at the time I turned her for her 2 hour turn schedule (note: asked the nurse what was the last hour my mother was turned and she said 90 minutes which by the time I asked that question made about 2.5 hours later since I had been there an hour already.and her and the 2nd shift nurse just walked out the room without turning her). I waited another 30 minutes, no one came so I turned her myself. Upon doing so, I found that the tube inserted was leaking which was the cause of the smell. I called the 2nd nurse 3 times which by now it's 90 minutes later that my mother was lying on sheets that were wet with poop water. The nurse came in with excuses with a lack, or sense of urgency. This is unacceptable because my mother has already had a bout with negligence at the hospital which caused the wounds on her hips. I vent here because Poinciana Management doesn't respond and therefore, no one address these issues as they haven't in the past. This is the reason the incompetence and lack of care, or real concern continues. . Hospital administration and staff have gone to the dogs. There is no more good customer service. I rate them an F. Management, a great deal more training needs to happen because some of these people are not fit to work with the sick, elderly and frail. Just because some have passed the state boards, many have failed tremendously in customer service.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/DUjEbUJColc8CukaFzeljw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Ella's A."}, {"timestamp": 1536872400, "content": "This hospital was spotless, professional and welcoming from the security guard to the ED Director!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Janet R."}, {"timestamp": 1483653600, "content": "This review is only for the emergency department..

Her surgeon, Jessica Gielow, DO, was outstanding and no complaints there. But the care in her 3rd floor room was just plain abominable. The nursing staff was undertrained and unmotivated. They made too many mistakes to enumerate here. Just two examples:. My friend has difficult-to-control blood pressure, and it was soaring most of the time.She has had the condition for many years and knows the best drug combination to keep it under control, but the staff would not listen to her. They persisted in doing very little and attributed their inaction to unavailability of IV forms of her customary medication. That may be, but in 4 days' time, they had plenty of time to research it and get her effective IV BP meds. But they did nothing and discounted her insistence that she needed a certain combination of meds. As soon as she was able to take her regular oral meds, her BP stabilized. But her upper number hovered unattended around 180 throughout her stay there. Stroke territory.. Second example: Upon her release, she asked her nurse if he was going to wheel her out or if she should walk. He said she could WALK! This is a patient who was identified as at risk of falling!!!! She insisted on a wheelchair to the front door (she also had some heavy bags to carry). He wheeled her but dumped her in the downstairs lobby, and when I drove up to the door, assuming she would be helped to the car, she had to ask a random good Samaritan in the lobby to help her out to the car. . It was a big deal to get a nurse's aide to make her bed or help her do anything. Unresponsive. A nurse stuck an IV line in her and missed the vein, so a big edema formed at the needle site. The nurse never checked to see if it was in right, and when I called her back, it took her about 20 minutes to get there. They hooked up all the IV lines and monitor lines wrong at first, and again when a physical therapist unhooked everything, the nursing staff did a Keystone Kops routine getting it hooked back up right. There was misinformation galore and multiple mistakes daily, so the patient's friends decided to post someone in the room as much as possible to protect her from serious mistakes.. This hospital is only a satellite facility and apparently lacks the meds, equipment and staffing resources of a major hospital. Unfortunately, too little, too late can have a devastating effect on a sick person. This was not the first negative experience I have had with Poinciana Medical Center.

I just received the LAST bill for my son's visit. Be WaRnEd , if you have private insurance with a deductible - consider going elsewhere unless it is truly life or death. I know I will. \u00a0Thank God for urgent care centers. Making a 3 year old wait for so long with a possible fracture was bad enough. Still getting billed over a year later is ridiculous. \u00a0Now I know better ! This last bill is for the facility charge. They billed the private insurance $4600. The insurance paid $1800, and my portion is $800. Ridiculous. See below , how they bill in portions (facility usage, plus labs and xrays, plus doctor visit (even though it's run by Physician Assistants). :(. *******. Update - the little one had a fall and possible broken bone. I went in here (mistake). We had to wait in the waiting area for at least 40 minutes. It was a show of 1/2 dressed people coughing everywhere. Maybe since my son wasn't crying ,they didn't feel it was urgent. I should have walked out. The wait was so long that when we finally were seen, they APOLOGIZED for the wait. If they properly triaged, they would have known that a possible fracture is more important than those that were ambulating well. . I got charged over $5000 for the visit. They had issues with billing. Once they got the billing straight, the cost came down. Be ware - they will be for the facility (hospital) + lab/xray + doctor (no doctor , just seen by PA)..
