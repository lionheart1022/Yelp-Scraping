They did a doctors visit for $89 and three x-rays of my foot for $50. That is with no insurance. So I thought that was cheap. Not to mention the staff was very friendly and I was in and out quicker than any doctor or ER that I have been in. They also do regular doctor visits for any age I believe since there is a family practice inside the same building. They were able to do the x-rays there on on-site and let me know if they saw any broken bones. They send the x-rays out anyway to a radiologist for confirmation. I was expecting to pay for my follow-up visit with the doctor to go over my x-rays again and any changes I may have had but it was free. I will definitely go there in the future.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/tps1NJyW93d2gf3iHrZP3Q/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Lindsey P."}, {"timestamp": 1532898000, "content": "What kind of doctors office DOESNT HAVE CHANGING TABLES. .

Got inside a room quickly since no one else was there, but waited in the room for 2 hours to be seen and discharged. I had to keep asking when I would be helped. \u00a0I opened the door and watched several people who worked there walk slowly passed me. \u00a0There was no urgency at all. \u00a0They didn't tell me how bad the sprain was and what I could expect for recovery even after I told them I needed to get back to work as soon as possible, which requires me to at least be able stand. \u00a0The female provider told the male doctor that that sounded absurd.. Some of us don't have sick leave. \u00a0She was unhelpful, disrespectful and insulting telling me what I already knew and nothing more. \u00a0She gave me no tips on how I could get back to work quicker, just the general prognosis you can find on any website.. When I was left in the room for a third extended period of time, the other doctor saw I was upset and said he would look at my ankle but I overheard him talking to the female provider instead, which is when she told him that what I said was \"absurd.\" \u00a0I couldn't believe I wasted $130 and two hours waiting for nothing. \u00a0When I left the waiting room was full. \u00a0I felt sorry for those people, since I was forgotten in my room for 2 hours for 5 minutes of interaction when there wasn't anyone else there.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FXhksEz4M_dy6XeyTHLc7A/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Pam R."}, {"timestamp": 1486072800, "content": "I use to like this place but it has gone to hell.

So not what I was expecting due to my past experiences at urgent cares. The staff was super casual, friendly, and helpful.

My prescriptions were ready for me by time I got to the pharmacy. Everything was great.
