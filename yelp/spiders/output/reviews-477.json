{"external_system_unique_id": 477, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1268863200, "content": "Be very careful if you see this doctor for substance abuse treatment. I took my daughter to him for treatment. He wrote a script for Suboxone without explaining the medications effect, use and most importantly exorbitant cost. The Suboxone mfr's site recommends discussing pros/cons of treatment and patient expectations. None of this was done; there are pamphlets on that site available which could provide this info at a minimum, they were not given to us. The manufacturer recommends urine and blood screening, this was not performed.. When I contacted the office after discovering that the meds would be $800 monthly for a full year to ask a few questions, or in lieu of that schedule an appointment (which I would have gladly paid for) his office staff took messages daily, and promised to call back for an entire week before finally telling me on my final call that the doctor has refused to see her or give medical advice for 30 days. This despite that I was told that the $250 cost of the initial treatment included 3 visits with the doctor. I have never had a doctor begin treatment with such a powerful medication in such a haphazard, and uncaring manner. His office staff is unorganized and rude. . If you just want a prescription, see this guy. If you want an ethical and responsible medical professional, \u00a0I strongly advise you to go to one of the other certified doctors in the area.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Wendy J."}, {"timestamp": 1504990800, "content": "Dr Felix gave me a urinalyst, well actually the staff gave me one, without even seeing the doctor first. All due to money becauae they said the first visit is $150, and then $50 every visit afterwards. But when I mentioned about paying the $50 what's up they said 150 and instantly urine tested me and failed me for methadone along with other things they never showed prroof of. And it cost me 40$ for the test , I was on suboxone and kalatopin so it was very bad to get this news when I knew it wasnt right. I demanaded my money back or a retest and they kicked me out. I went to another doctor the same day, and didnt fail for any of the things they had claimed I was under the influence of. So I had to pay another 300$ just to see a new doctor that day. This Felix Dr is a scam artist, and I'm not going to give up until I get back every penny I gave to that place. Idc if I have to go to judge Judy or not. This was my first visit back, this is by far the most disrespectful and uncaring doctor ive met!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/2WZd8Bd3dVSVTFGjokLlyA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Cody W."}, {"timestamp": 1463000400, "content": "THE new office is on 11602 lake underhill rd #115 orlando fl 32858 phone #407-802-4655 .
