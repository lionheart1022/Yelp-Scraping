I just wanted to take a moment and let Osceola County know how un-accommodating Dr Ly and his office East Lake Medical Clinic at 4737 Old Canoe Creek Rd has been. \u00a0I am a stem cell donor who requires medication that was requested by Columbia hospital of New York before my donation. \u00a0This was something that had been communicated through both email and verbal telephone conversation with both Dr Ly and the fine folks at Columbia Presbyterian. \u00a0I was told that this was going to be waiting for me in the office pending my pick up, I called to pick up the script and I was told that it had not been written as previously promised and that 2 hours prior to the office closing there was NO one there capable of writing the script that was supposed to be on my file. \u00a0I was told that the doctor was in the hospital I went as far as to ask if I could pick up the script at the hospital and was left HELPLESS, the receptionist even went as far to say that they may require me to pay a co-pay!!??? \u00a0Thanks for your support Dr Ly and Staff I'm sure that the public will also see how well you support Cancer victims and their families... Am I a patient or a customer??!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jason H."}, {"timestamp": 1431378000, "content": "Wish the front desk was a little more polite.
