I rescheduled, only to be called and asked to move my appointment again because the PA scheduled to do my physical as taking some time off (*wait...what?*) so once again I had to reschedule. Then, I had to reschedule myself, which was not the fault of the office but would have been unnecessary had I been able to go to my original appointment. When I finally went, my exam was thorough, so no complaints there. However, I requested that an explanation of reason be included with one of my prescription refills because the insurance company sometimes balks at the amount, because its migraine medication, and I need it often. She didn't do that, and then the office called to tell me I had to come in again because the pharmacy was questioning the amount of my meds. Now my husband went for a physical and was told they would schedule him a routine colonoscopy and let him know when and where. That never happened either.

Now this review is about the clinic as a whole, not necessarily for Dr Kobobel. He seems OK. My experience so far is that they have the WORST service of any medical office I have EVER been to. On two separate occasions I have tried to get my blood pressure meds refilled and called in and went to their refill selection. I have had to leave a message because I have NEVER had anyone answer the phone at this clinic. . I left a message with my name, phone number and the med that needed refilled. That was early in the morning. I never received a call back. It took me two days to finally get someone and then they proceed to tell me that they would refill it this time but they needed to get blood tests done. That's their way of getting that extra charge from you and your insurance. . Now jump ahead 30 days later and the EXACT same thing. I have tried to get in touch with them with no luck. Called first thing in the morning. No answer. Left my message and nothing. I called back and no answer again. I tried calling again at 5:45 pm and still no answer. They don't close until around 8 pm. This is ridiculous. I have not received a call about the tests or a return call about my refill now for two times in a row. . I will be looking for a new primary care provider and I suggest you do the same.. 1/20/14---An Update---There is also a place on their Facebook account where you can review them so I put a review up about how terrible the service was and my experience of this location. Then who ever manages their Facebook page gets on and makes a comment saying that I had been harassing the staff (I guess the few times I called and left messages on their voicemail asking for my prescription refilled or for someone to call me back is a little too harassing) and then another post saying that they had reported me to the local authorities and to remove the post or they would file legal charges against me. I responded accordingly and they removed their part of the posts. I supposed you can only review their clinic if it's a positive review!!. New Update: 10/14/2016: Haven't been back but look at all of the reviews since my first one!! Wow!! It looks like this place just keeps it up.

The pharmacy apologized for the delay but the office had to get the authorization for it. Thankfully my husbands insurance didn't need an auth so I could use his. I thought a busy season for flu and virus I'll let it go. Then was there for a surgery clearance and the PA was worried about a EKG and ordered a ultrasound done a few days later at their other clinic. I was told if I didn't hear anything within a week to call. No surprise I had to call no answer. I repeatedly called and the doctors office doing my surgery was calling. No response. I had to call and demand testing because I was within days of my surgery which was a month after starting to get clearance. At this point being worried something was wrong with my heart! Finally! Having to threaten getting my attorney involved my surgeon got the results two days before my surgery. All was okay but test results were poor quality making reading the report difficult and was on the first fax that they claimed they never received.
