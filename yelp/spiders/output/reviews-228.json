The staff are all professional and courteous and I never wait more than 10 minutes to be called in for my appointment. I see Julie Pistorino PA for my skin exams. She is extremely thorough and explains everything to me in a manner that I can understand. She answers my questions and addresses all of my concerns. On my last visit with Julie I had 2 biopsies. One of them was a skin cancer that required Mohs surgery. When I received the call about my results, everything was explained in detail before my appointment was scheduled. My surgeon Dr. Priya Nayyar was amazing. She also explained everything prior to my surgery and was very calming and reassuring throughout the procedure. Its been almost 3 months and I can barely see the scar on my cheek. I am so happy I decided not to go to a plastic surgeon. Dr. Nayyar is highly skilled and compassionate. I would not hesitate to recommend this office to family and friends (I often do) The nurses here are knowledgeable and caring. They make me feel comfortable and well informed. My experience is always wonderful from the moment I walk in until I leave. Thank you all for being so great at what you do!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Donna C."}]}
