This time it was to go over the results of my recent blood tests. Well I cannot begin to to tell you how impressed I was with the Doctor and his staff also. He took almost an hour to go over my blood work results line by line with a complete explanation of each test and what the results meant for me going forward. He told me what medication he was going to prescribe and why, and how it works, and what side effects to look out for. He took care to prescribe only generics to save me money. Most of all he spoke to me as an adult intelligent human being. The fact that he cared about me as a person was obvious. Highly recommended if you are looking for an internist.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/9JWFbgrOXfTudssIknWtEA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Anthony S."}, {"timestamp": 1401829200, "content": "Where do I start... When in the hospital he took over 5 hrs to come see me after sending his nurse to tell me he was on his way. Then made every excuse to keep me there. He wasn't even the doctor I requested.
