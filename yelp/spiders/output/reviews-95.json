When I've needed an off-cycle visit, it hasn't been too difficult to get in to see her.. Excellent facility! Very modern and clear. Wait time was 10-15 min.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/UIv5o1nJ1Qucz1qwkpBPzw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Albert P."}, {"timestamp": 1463000400, "content": "So I am writing this review while sitting on the waiting room. I haven't even seen a doctor and already I am thinking 1 star. Here is why:. 1. Came in to no one being at the front desk(see photo). 2. Is it not a HIPPA issue to see everyone that has signed in before me?. 3. When I made the appt they told me to come in 20mins before which I did. I waited 20 minutes and then finally went up to a woman that walked to the desk and told her, \"Hey, I am here for an appt\". She said \"Okay\" and was about to walk away. I had to ask for New Patient Paperwork. . The only reason I give it 3 Stars is because I enjoyed my interacted with the doc I saw. She was pleasant and thorough. I would not recommend this place if you are in a rush or and looking for great front desk staff.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/y9wgucXyBTlBptuTynl5EA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 3, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Ivelisse S."}]}
