Terrible communication and DOES NOT CARE about the patients' well being. . My husband has chronic pain issues and got his card. In 2017, he was hospitalized for most of the year and had 6 operations. At one point he politely asked the Dr to up his dosage and mgs because his pain was so severe (keep in mind he had 6 operations in one year). He needed more mgs to which the Dr. accused him of being a drug dealer and said \"you're a drug dealer and must be dealing\" and he wouldn't raise his mgs for pain. . Whenever I did have to drive my husband to a store, either the prescription wasn't called in or he wasn't prescribed the right dosages. The Dr. charged our account for $75 in one month. Apparently they had missed charging the normal $25 per month and without notifying us put the charge through. Are you kidding me??? NOT our fault and maybe you should have communication with the patients as to what you are taking from our account so as not screw up our funds. . This month my husband called their office on July 9th to confirm that his account was in good standing and the receptionist said yes, everything is good. So, they charged the card for the $25 on July 12th. Meanwhile, his PRESCRIPTION WAS CANCELLED on July 10th but mind you he was still charged on the 12th, AFTER HE WAS CANCELLED. HOW IS THIS RIGHT? We just left the store today. AGAIN...we wasted gas and time to get there and have to turn around empty handed. My husband is in severe pain and this Dr. has not been there throughout his rehabilitation and has been made matters worse instead of better. . There are many Dr's in Florida now helping patients like my husband get the medicine that they need. This is NOT one of them.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/rO05UnPeEcFKCxxPKbpWfA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Steph P."}, {"timestamp": 1531688400, "content": "Very frustrating experience!
