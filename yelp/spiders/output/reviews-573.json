She's a wonderful doctor whose friendliness and attention to detail have impressed us both. The office runs efficiently with short waits to get in to see the doc. One time we had an urgent issue arise, called Dr. Yeli and she saw us the next morning. We appreciate her care and her bedside manner.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/80Rq6n9waHQmXrXaGb-85w/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Nibbler D."}, {"timestamp": 1508274000, "content": "No one returns phone calls. \u00a0I've been trying to get test results several time and they just don't call back. \u00a0Go elsewhere.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Kris B."}]}
