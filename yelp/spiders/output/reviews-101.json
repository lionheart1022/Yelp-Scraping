Tomorrow , I am going to sit and type all that happened today at this office . You won't even believe it !! \u00a0I am going to start by saying that the medical assistant introduced herself as \"the nurse\" . When I asked her if she was a registered nurse she said she was \"a nurse\" and I asked again what are your credentials and she finally said : I am a medical assistant but the nurse in the room ?!!!!!!! Her name is ASHLEY. \u00a0When I told her the illegality of the misrepresentation she got infuriated and stumped out of the room .. impersonating a nurse is a crime. And even though a medical assistant may believe what they are doing is innocent, in reality it is a crime. What they are actually doing is misrepresenting themselves and leading people to believe that they have a greater level of education and qualification than they have. Just like a physician held legally responsible for practicing medicine without a license, medical assistants that call themselves nurses can be held legally responsible for practicing nursing without a license. Depending on the laws of your state it can either be considered misdemeanor or felony. Practicing nursing without a license is always a criminal act which is punishable by the sentencing rules of the appropriate statute. It is illegal in all states to claim a license you do not have..  Tomorrow, I will tell you about the doctor . I need his name first ... you won't even believe the things he said ... by the way , he did not examine the patient ... i wonder if he is going to bill the insurance company?!!!! Go figure !", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hfOKgnm6dtfaxCykXb-0YA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Heidi T."}, {"timestamp": 1517781600, "content": "Scam.
