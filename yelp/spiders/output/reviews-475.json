I went to this clinic for the first time and waited two hours to see the doctor with an appointment. Finally doctor Bruno comes in does not say hello or introduce himself. He looks at the computer and asks me if I am a new patient, when I tell him I am he gets all pissed off and says to me he can't understand why they keep giving him new patients. After hearing that I got up and walked out only to see at least twenty people waiting to be seen. All were complaining about the long wait. This place is way overbooked and money hungry to the bone. Stay away.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Brad K."}, {"timestamp": 1490648400, "content": "Their slogan is \"We love our patients\", and it is the biggest joke on the planet. \u00a0On the poster with their slogan is a list of ways to help keep you healthy. \u00a0Another joke, # 1 on the list is to try to avoid stress. They are a major contributing factor. \u00a0My husband and I have put up with the inefficient office staff and nurses who never return calls, for 3 years because we love our caregiver at this facility, but enough is enough. \u00a0If you want to go to this clinic be prepared to deal with the fact that you are only a dollar sign to them. They do not value your time and have no problem with making you wait while they call a staff meeting, etc.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Janet S."}, {"timestamp": 1429736400, "content": "I went to this clinic for the first time and waited two hours to see the doctor with an appointment.
