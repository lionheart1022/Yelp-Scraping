Over the course of the next few visits that proved wrong. I was fine with the wait, the location and the facility itself, even the staff seemed nice. However I picked this place to see Dr. Yee, who in my handful of times I only saw once for 5 mins. Her assistants and staff took care of me for the most part. What's the real issue? I went in for a physical and blood work in October, it's going to be December and I am still going back and forth for test results. Just when I thought I was done with my appointments for \u00a0this physical, her assistant tells me my liver enzymes were high and if I was A, drinking protein shakes, or B, am I a drinker. I had to wait a month to get retested. When I finally come in, fasted for 12 hrs, get up at 7am on my day off, everything goes as planned. Until a week later. I call for my results, nothing, I check the online portal, nothing. They finally call me back and they're confused. \"What test results? We don't have anything in the system or on file\". They finally track down results, which were old ones regarding an irrelevant test. I clarify this and she puts me on hold again. When she gets back on she tells me \"Oh we didn't test your liver enzymes again, we did however check you for chlamydia and it was negative.\" First off, I didn't need to get checked for that again as I already knew I was negative. I was waiting on results for something THEY told me was off, that had never been an issue before, my liver enzymes! And they don't run the test and took another one instead. This is my health that we're talking about and this physical and the last few months has really been an inconvenience. Dr. Yee needs to spend more time with her patients and less time delegating. This situation really upset me and was uncalled for. Though it probably won't matter to her busy schedule, today she lost a patient that could have been longterm business for her.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Brian D."}, {"timestamp": 1487541600, "content": "You can easily wait for 3 hours.
