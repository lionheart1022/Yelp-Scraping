{"external_system_unique_id": 403, "reviews": [{"timestamp": 1498683600, "content": "I have been a patient at this location for almost a year and had never had an issue and never complained no matter how many doctors, specialists, & testing the recommended I have done. Lets get real, I live everyday to go see another specialist or have another test, NOT. . I would drive every month from Riverview to the Tampa location off Memorial Hwy (45 mins) to see my Dr and get meds refilled plus drive 45 mins to Sarasota every month to see my specialist and then whatever blood tests they wanted tested and then re tested. I understand that my health is important but so is my sanity and stress level, Oh did I mention my children are also important and have to tag along to all my appointments (4 year old & 1 year old). . My last straw was the last Rx pick up at their pharmacy when I stood there at the window inside for 10 mins until someone acknowledged me, apparently something in their tiny medication fridge was more important. . I was seeing Dr. Madelynn Schrenock and everything was fine with the care from her, she actually started giving me refills on my meds so I wouldnt have to come back every single month and fight I275 & I4 interstates (which always end up giving me panic attacks by the end of the day), I literally loath going to the Dr becuse of this. After Madelynn left I came to the Dr surprised to have another Dr to see me. Of course more blood tests and then forgot to give me my medication. I had to have the little Pharmacy there in the building call the Dr so he could walk over and give them the Rx. After all these small annoying things plus the looooong drive, I would rather not. Now it just seems like the $$$ is more important to them than the patients care, Give another test, see another specialist, come in next month for medication, all that adds up to more $$$ to charge the insurance companies and definitely not thinking about the time and inconvenience or headache that all these appointments give the patients. I could understand if I was a new patient but Im not. After going there for almost a year and extremely compliant they just let me down.......I guess I just dont speak the language. My attorney does though", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/bLgkqFGTinLyoT4I9BTA0g/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jennifer B."}, {"timestamp": 1498510800, "content": "I can't put words together to describe my experience here...it's actually pretty comical. After 45mins, I'm still being screened by the \"Medical Assistant\" who I honestly don't believe has studies or knowledge of his job. The biggest clue?? He stuck his exposed finger in my urine cup! No clue about sanitary testing. He couldn't believe that at my age I never had a pregnancy. Professionalism a complete flop. The Dr didn't introduce himself, and is not shy about hiding his arrogance as he waved his hips from side to side while slurping a Frap. Also insisted on having me come back to discuss test results from my former Dr. Why???? Not coming back!!!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/LNuElP3gClOe04baC4BvrA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Elvis K."}]}
