Every time I come here I get a different doctor and to get anywhere it's like pulling teeth or an act of Congress. Every appointment I come to, there is always an outstanding bill even though I pay in full every time I come. And after coming here for a couple years I have finally decided to leave after what happened today. They refuse to sign my FMLA paperwork for anxiety issues. Apparently spending 40 days in a psychiatric ward does not qualify for having anxiety issues (despite prescribing me medication for anxiety). The most unbelievable part? They made this decision before even reviewing my history from a previous hospital. Look elsewhere for your medical needs. They do not care about your physical or mental health.
