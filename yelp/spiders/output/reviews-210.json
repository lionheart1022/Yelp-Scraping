In fact, when you get your paperwork it tells you that. \u00a0This has been my experience with every provider here in the last 8 years and in my home state of Pennsylvania.. Also, every provider that I have EVER had in my whole life, in both states make you come back on another visit to get your lab work results UNLESS there is an emergency and you need to seek attention right away as per your results. \u00a0And trust me, I have several chronic conditions and see a LOT of doctors.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/1klEVOFepi1ZnwXc7rjN4g/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Renita D."}, {"timestamp": 1496782800, "content": "Dr. Wu is my mother's doctor. \u00a0I have taken my mother there several times in the past few years. \u00a0We are always needing to wait at least an hour before the getting in to see her. \u00a0When she does any blood work she refuses to give you the results unless you come back to her office for another appointment. \u00a0Geez I wonder why, maybe so she can bill medicare again for another office visit? \u00a0My mother does not drive, so someone has to take her. \u00a0I live out of the state so I cannot go. \u00a0They will not even tell me if my mother's medication needs to stay the same or needs to be adjusted unless she comes in. \u00a0We will be looking for another doctor.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/LZQTRGHEV2FK39mM8_p_Cw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Lori D."}, {"timestamp": 1422223200, "content": "I went to Advance Primary care, which is run by a Chinese physician, by the name of Amanda Wu. for checkup. The appointment time was 11:15 am and after filling out necessary forms, at noon I was told by the front office staff that I need to pay my co-payment first which is only $25.00. I told the staff that the doctor Wanda WU has not even examined yet and why do I have to pay the co-payment first without being examined. The office staff said that they had incidence that the patience do not pay after being examined. I told the office staff that I am paying $398 a month for this insurance and I will not run away and not pay $25.00. I then asked the office staff to call the doctor and when the doctor came she said no no no , co-payment need now. I told the doctor that when you go to the restaurant, you eat first and then pay and I do the same, get service first and then I rendered the payment. And if you do take $25.00 co-payment, which I intend to pay through my credit card, I can always call my credit card provided and file for dispute. She then kept quite and I got disgusted and took my forms that I had filled out and left her office. . I intend to call the state and file a complaint. No wonder this Wanda Wu has terrible reviews so the other patient who has reviewed her are absolutely correct.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "A P."}]}
