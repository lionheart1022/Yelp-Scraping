The first appointment always takes longer because of the initial paperwork. . Even with the paperwork, I felt the wait time of 1 1/2 hours was excessive.. The doctor & staff were pleasant. The doctor was thorough & asked appropriate questions & made 3 referrals. I' m not quite sure if he understands me yet, that would be quite difficult after 1 visit & not having my medical records.. The office was clean & comfortable. No medications were refilled, I need to check on that. Overall a good first visit.. What's a girl to do? Gotta wait & see how things pan out, so far it's looking good.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/YOc_HKPW-a8_fT3W_5pRFw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 3, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Kathy D."}, {"timestamp": 1516485600, "content": "I called and made an appointment in the morning. They were kind enough to fit me in. . My symptoms were improving but I still could not sleep after 3 nights of coughing. The doctor told me to call if this happened. Sure enough, on a Sunday, the doctor called shortly after I left a message with his answering service. . He prescribed me a cough medicine that helped me sleep and I was better in 2 days. . The staff was personable and took good care of me. I'll go back here if I need to in the future.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/8kp82YjhNP-VRZFFtsTfYA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 4, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jim M."}, {"timestamp": 1498078800, "content": "Excellent doctor & staff.
