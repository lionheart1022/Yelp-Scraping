The service there at the Clark Clinic has always been pretty bad, but this time it was just too much for me. After sitting there in the prison cell style room for over two hours, I could not take it anymore and had to get up and leave. Not surprising, the office staff did not seem to care at all. Also, they play games with your prescriptions making it difficult to refill. This way they can keep you coming back so you can pay them more money.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "K M."}]}
