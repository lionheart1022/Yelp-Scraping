I went in as a walk in the day school started in our area because she had just moved here. Needless to say they were very busy with people who had waited last minute for the same thing but USA Medical Care had no problem taking us in. For only $20, my daughter had her physical done and a certificate printed. The staff is very friendly and they are up front with their costs and procedures. Nothing shady about this place. I have even used them when I was ill and an office visit of $39 when I don't have insurance was perfect.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Ke40iKP8847jL7fCrnL6yQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 4, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Sarah H."}, {"timestamp": 1422050400, "content": "The place was very filthy and dirty. The waiting wasn't long and the price wasn't expensive but the staff was rude and the doctor was too apathetic to give me a diagnose or even explain which medicine was for what purpose. They send me to do a blood test which was forever far away.
