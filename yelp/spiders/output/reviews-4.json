I was hard-pressed to find a quality diagnostic facility! There were issues with facilities that were in my plan, timing of appointments, and quality of the images obtained. After speaking to the office manager, Barbara, she appointed me to the place that she had been previously. I could tell that she took great care as to guiding me to that facility she talked about her own health struggles. I would just like to write a wonderful review to the manager who appointed me to the MRI facility center in Boca for woman. I am very grateful for the staff at the Boca office.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/x_0s25jAP6QIwQ2Qat0KBQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Linda M."}, {"timestamp": 1478210400, "content": "Dr Robb is amazing but I wish the office staff would get it together when it comes to ins they don't know what insurance they take the insult the patients in front of other patients and when they give you an appointment they never put it in the computer and when you come in on your appointment date they that you don't have an appointment on that day . after while it becomes annoying. Dr. Robb is fantastic. I would never trade Dr .Robb for the world. I was diagnosed with radiation pulmonary fibrosis he knew before anyone \u00a0else did.
