I went with her when she had an appointment with Dr. Harlow. She was fantastic! She really spent a lot of time with us asking lots of questions in order to point us in the right direction for a full diagnosis. If I didn't already have a doctor, I would come here. You can tell she loves what she does and is good with her patients. . Their office looks new and is well kept. The wait was very minimal in the waiting room our nurse was also great.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ogrzqJmwaFebISS1a-SzBg/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Stephanie W."}, {"timestamp": 1534453200, "content": "I have been a patient at this practice for years. I've had a few issues in that time, but nothing major. I will say, even though Dr Soni is my primary care doctor, I have never actually met the woman. I've always been seen by nurses or PA's.. I went to see my ophthalmologist recently and they determined that I need to have eye surgery. I saw the surgeon last week and they scheduled the surgery for two weeks out, with my pre-op appointment next week. I just got the registration paperwork for the surgery center today and there's a medical release form that I need to have signed by my PCP. . I have no medical conditions, take no medications, and I'm relatively young and healthy, no problems. So I called and asked if they'd sign it, but of course they won't without an appointment. That's fine, I understand. My pre-op appointment is next week, but Dr Soni's office doesn't have availability for three to four weeks!! And the receptionist was very rude! I explained that I need this surgery and I need to have this form signed so that I can have it done, and she said \"What do you want me to do? I can't double book the physician!\" in a snotty tone.. UNBELIEVABLE!! I'm done with this place!", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/P4SdQvSOpDDHbLw_q6Y_3Q/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 2, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Jeni M."}, {"timestamp": 1525208400, "content": "My children were patients here for over a year before I was able to change physicians. I was also a patient. . I can really only recommend two of the nurses (who were very nice). I did not like Dr. Soni whatsoever nor really the assistants who frequently see you. . She did not have very good bedside manner - and I found she did not really listen to us. She was very pushy with certain medications & just not on the same page as myself or my children . Was very happy to change physicians. I can't recommend Dr. Soni or her clinic, personally. . Ps wait times can be very excessive & the scheduling nurse has a poor attitude (even toward the other nurses).", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fY2wUkfhRoulAuUYPgZjnw/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Rachel J."}, {"timestamp": 1531688400, "content": "Dr. Soni is a really nice lady. \u00a0However if your sick and need to see her forget it.
