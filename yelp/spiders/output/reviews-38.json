I went with a friend to this \"practitioner\" (I use this term loosely) to help them with some medical issues. First off, her bedside manner is a joke, not once did she ask any pertinent info, also, the staff is lax. Needed a referral for another doctor, I left 4 messages and had to repeatedly call for the referral. Also, once my friend received a date for his referral, this doctor intentionally, blocked that appointment by having him come to the office that day!! THAT DAY!!! To get a prescription! She told him if he did not come to the office that he would not get his medications. When contacted to inform her if the other doctors appointment ( that she knew about) she refused to she him another day. Just poor overall Florida doctor, that probably practices here, because she was unable to make it up north. I am not one to write a scathing review, yet this one needs it. Unethical, and immoral, poor bedside manner, and coming from another medical professional (that has been in practice longer than her) Shame on her. To top it off this patient is disabled.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/j_ZaH7WhDIa64CIpHbF07w/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Sicilian Omerta' _."}]}
