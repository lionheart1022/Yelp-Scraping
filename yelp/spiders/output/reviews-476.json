I like the office staff too. I have been going to him for a while now and Dr Brinson is always very pleasant, takes his time to answer all of my questions, and didn't feel rushed at all. I have recommended him to a lot of people. I choose closest to natural -foods, products, supplements etc. to balance out any nutritional needs as many people going organic& \u00a0farm to table. He was quite knowledgeable about htpothyroid metabolism and weight loss & 90% of doctors are not. Every person I know now is health-conscious, seeking fit trim healthy lifestyles &using some type of supplements. A lot doctors don't even try or take classes to get Wisdom, understanding \u00a0& knowledge about alternative choices, fit lifestyles and research. If You're seeking a healthy lifestyle wanna look younger, feel better, lose weight, get fit, get rid of wrinkles, he's the man. He also has Hormone therapy, Botox injections, all natural alternatives for wrinkles, and some other things as well. 5", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/rrstfawIxffvs8UcezM-pA/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 5, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Renee A."}, {"timestamp": 1492635600, "content": "Disappointing to say the least. \u00a0No compassion from this doctor.

I heard how nice and easy to talk to Dr.Brinson was but I don't know. The doctor seemed a bit sleepy and annoyed by my presence today. I mean it wasn't like overtly rude by any measure but have you ever gotten that feeling, when talking to someone, that they'd rather be somewhere else? It was kind of like that. The nurses there are awesome and really make you feel at home. The nurses get 5 stars. But I don't know.

Nurses and staff were excellent which is the main reason I came back for the second visit. I did get the feeling he didn't want to be there and didn't have a sensitive bone in his body. I was a bit confused with my medication refill and perhaps I was unclear... but to get a response like, \" What were we in that room (pointing to the exam room) talking about the whole time?\" I felt stupid and ignorant as he spoke to me in front of his staff. \u00a0I am new to the area, relocating from California...what a horrible experience.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Marizza A."}]}
