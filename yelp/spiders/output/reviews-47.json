But, that's what they gave me!! Refused to refer me out. \u00a0NEVER NOT ONCE DID THEY TELL ME THEY WERE SELF REFERRAL ONLY!!! \u00a0So, after being told to take not one, not two, but THREE medications, I tried it. \u00a0The medications gave me horrible side effects.... their advice...Keep taking them! (Paxil was causing my heart rate to reach 150) I ask AGAIN about referral... \"yes, sure.. watch me put your referral in the computer...call back the next day about referral, \"oh we don't refer out, it is self referral only\" Then why the heck did the doctor tell me she was submitting a referral????? \u00a0Nothing but the run around to keep you coming back so they can bill your insurance. They will never get another dime from me. \u00a0and i would advise anyone looking for good medical care to pass right over this place.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/U5s8dqmlai0ocPITN7Y81w/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Vicki M."}]}
