The doctor's ads claim to listen to the patient, but this doctor in particular wrote a misdiagnosis in my file , and it was reported to my insurance company, and the doctor was not going to correct it because it would make her look bad, and cause a lawsuit if she were wrong. Now my insurance company won't cover anything because of this wrong diagnosis. Very unhappy.", "photos": {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/LPM5sTgY7vRIGX7E9dPYLQ/60s.jpg", "description": ""}, "review_title": "", "stars": 1, "provider": "yelp", "reviewer_name": "Evie M."}]}
